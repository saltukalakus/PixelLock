PixelLock is a command-line tool to secure your pictures with military-grade encryption. It helps enhance privacy and provide an additional layer of security while storing images. Image formats currently supported are JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, and WebP. 

![Flow](https://github.com/saltukalakus/PixelLock/blob/main/Flow.png)

### Build Requirements
- Rust (1.87.0 or later)
- Cargo (1.87.0 or later)

[Go to the installation guide.](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

### Building the Project

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saltukalakus/PixelLock.git
   cd PixelLock
   cargo build --release
   ```

These steps generate the executable **PixelLock** in the `/target/release` directory.

### Usage

Encrypting a single image, embedding it into a provided base PNG:
```bash
./target/release/PixelLock -e -i ./secret_image.jpeg -o ./stego_image -b ./my_base.png
# Output will be ./stego_image.png (using my_base.png as a carrier, 1 LSB)
```

Decrypting a steganographic PNG image to reveal the secret image:
```bash
./target/release/PixelLock -d -i ./stego_image.png -o ./secret_image
# Output extension will be based on detected original format, e.g., ./secret_image.jpeg
```

Encrypting all images in a folder, embedding them into a provided base PNG:
```bash
./target/release/PixelLock -e -i ./image-folder -o ./stego_folder -b ./my_base.png
```

Decrypting all steganographic PNG images in a folder to an output folder:
```bash
./target/release/PixelLock -d -i ./stego_folder -o ./image-folder
```

For a full list of available options, try the help command:

```bash
./target/release/PixelLock --help  
```
