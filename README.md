##

PixelLock is a command-line tool to secure your pictures with military-grade encryption. It helps enhance privacy and provide an additional layer of security while storing images. 

Image formats currently supported are JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, and WebP. 

The tool allows you to generate encrypted files in two different formats: Base64 text or a PNG image. 

You may optionally pass a PNG formatted base image to hide your encrypted image in it if the output format is selected as PNG. When the base image is provided the tool allows configuring the blending ratio to decide the final generated picture distortion level vs the output file size.

You may open any feature requests in the issues section. Please check existing open issues before opening a new one.

##  ✨ Building the Project ✨

Requirements
- Rust (1.87.0 or later)
- Cargo (1.87.0 or later)

[Go to the installation guide.](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saltukalakus/PixelLock.git
   cd PixelLock
   cargo build --release
   ```

These steps generate the executable **PixelLock** in the `/target/release` directory.

## 🪄 Usage 🪄

* Encrypting a single image, embedding it into a provided base PNG:
```bash
> PixelLock -e -i ./secret_image.jpeg -o ./stego_image -b ./my_base.png
# Output will be ./stego_image.png (using my_base.png as a carrier, 1 LSB)
```

* Decrypting a steganographic PNG image to reveal the secret image:
```bash
> PixelLock -d -i ./stego_image.png -o ./secret_image
# Output extension will be based on detected original format, e.g., ./secret_image.jpeg
```

* Encrypting all images in a folder, embedding them into a provided base PNG:
```bash
> PixelLock -e -i ./image-folder -o ./stego_folder -b ./my_base.png

Input
 ├── img-folder
     └── Image1.jpg
     └── Image2.png
Output
 ├── stego_folder
     └── Image1.jpg.png
     └── Image2.png.png
```

* Decrypting all steganographic PNG images in a folder to an output folder:
```bash
> PixelLock -d -i ./stego_folder -o ./image-folder

Input
 ├── stego_folder
     └── Image1.jpg.png
     └── Image2.png.png
Output
 ├── img-folder
     └── Image1.jpg
     └── Image2.png
```

*  📖 For a full list of available options, try the help command:

```bash
> PixelLock --help  
```

## 💥 Security Challenge 💥

This is an open challenge for those interested in bug bounties. Find a way to decrypt the secret images in this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/saltukalakus/3ed86910ea2eee6c6e72f8def4c6017c). If you can decrypt at least one of the images, you win 500 GBP 💰 

The challenge is time-boxed. It will end on July 31, 2025, at 1 PM UTC. I will share the secret in the same Gist in the comments section if no one can hack it by then. All the other details are in the Gist including the rules and conditions.

To the best of my knowledge, the security choices and the used libraries in this project are solid. If you are able to break it you should be a security 🧙‍♂️
